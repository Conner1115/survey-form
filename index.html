  <p id = "story"> I am currently thirteen years old and here is how I started coding...<br><br>Before I found <a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org" target = "_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>, my story goes a long way back... 
My mom was going to have a baby (my first brother) and her midwife flew over from the US to Hong Kong, where I lived previously. Surprisingly, she started me in programming when I was eleven. she told my mom about <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>. After I learned basic PJS, I decided that I would become a programmer. I stuck to Khan for a long time and I learned HTML, CSS, DOM and Jquery. Yeah, I learned DOM, but forgot almost all of it and stuck to Jquery. A few years later, we moved to Texas and my mom found out about freecodecamp. it was pretty hard to stay at freecodecamp and throw away khan academy. Within two years, my account got banned about three times, I gave up at it and stuck to freecodecamp and <a target = "_blank" href = "https://codpen.io">codepen</a> of course. Now I'm thirteen and I am trying to learn as much as possible at FCC. I thank all of the kind, smart, and awesome community at the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum">Freecodecamp Forum</a> for their cool tips and help.</p>

    It may not look like much, but it is so fun to play with. Find your silly personality and laugh your head off.

    I personally think that this is one of my best freecodecamp projects. It is a tech doc about jquery.

    I made my first game out of HTML and it ended up as an awesome multiple-choice game.

    As you have seen my first game, this is the second part to it. Some people are encouraging me to do part three.
